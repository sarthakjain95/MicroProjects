## Why is this?  
  
Conway's Game of life is a cellular automaton. It's zero player game that requires only initial stage to drive the game. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.
