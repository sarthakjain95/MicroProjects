# Shape Drop Visualizer
  

## Why is this?  
  
A few months ago, I Encountered a Competitive Programming Problem that was very hard to complete without good visualization of what was going on in the problem. This project is an attempt to make that visualization part easier and to push me to think about the problem even more. It's okay if you don't find this very useful.   
  

## What is this? How do I use this?
  
It's a Shape Drop Visualizer.  
There are two types of cells:
1. Object cell  
2. Obstacle cell
  
Initially, when the page loads, the system accepts an Object cell.   
When you're done making objects, you can click on the *ADD DROP CELLS* Bar. (That's the control bar). Clicking that will allow the system to accept obstacle cells.   
Once you are done adding obstacle cells, Again click the control bar to RUN the visualization.
